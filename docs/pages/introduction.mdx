A **NestJS-inspired dependency injection framework** for Dart, bringing modular architecture and type-safe service management to Dart applications across all platforms.

## What is Nest Dart?

Nest Dart is a powerful dependency injection framework that brings the proven architectural patterns from NestJS to the Dart ecosystem. It provides a modular, scalable, and maintainable way to organize your Dart applications with strict encapsulation and type-safe service resolution.

## Key Features

- 🏗️ **Modular Architecture** - Organize code into reusable, self-contained modules
- 💉 **Dependency Injection** - Type-safe service resolution powered by GetIt
- 🔒 **Access Control** - Services are private by default, must be explicitly exported
- 🔄 **Lifecycle Management** - Module initialization and cleanup hooks
- 🧪 **Testing Support** - Easy mocking and isolated testing
- 🔧 **Multi-Platform** - Works with Flutter, Dart Frog, and pure Dart applications
- ⚡ **Performance** - Minimal overhead with compile-time safety
- 📦 **Workspace Support** - Melos-based monorepo structure

## Architecture Overview

Nest Dart follows a hierarchical module system where:

```
ApplicationContainer
├── AppModule (Root)
    ├── CoreModule
    │   ├── ConfigService
    │   ├── LoggerService
    │   └── DatabaseService
    ├── UserModule
    │   ├── UserService
    │   └── UserRepository
    └── AuthModule
        ├── AuthService
        └── JwtService
```

### Core Concepts

- **Modules**: Self-contained units that group related services
- **Providers**: Services, repositories, and other injectable classes
- **Exports**: Services that a module makes available to other modules
- **Imports**: Dependencies on other modules
- **Container**: The central registry that manages all services

## Packages

Nest Dart is organized into three main packages:

### `nest_core`
The foundation package providing:
- Module system and dependency injection
- ApplicationContainer for service management
- Lifecycle hooks (onModuleInit, onModuleDestroy)
- Type-safe service resolution with access control

### `nest_flutter`
Flutter integration providing:
- ModularApp widget for easy setup
- ApplicationContainerProvider for widget tree integration
- Reactive container updates with ChangeNotifier
- Context-based service access

### `nest_frog`
Dart Frog backend integration providing:
- Middleware for automatic container initialization
- Request context service resolution
- Unified Modular API for backend services
- Seamless integration with Dart Frog's middleware system

## Quick Example

Here's a simple example showing how to create and use modules:

```dart
import 'package:nest_core/nest_core.dart';

// Define a service
class UserService {
  final LoggerService _logger;
  
  UserService(this._logger);
  
  List<String> getUsers() {
    _logger.log('Fetching users');
    return ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'];
  }
}

// Create a module
class UserModule extends Module {
  @override
  List<Module> get imports => [CoreModule()];
  
  @override
  void providers(Locator locator) {
    locator.registerSingleton<UserService>(
      UserService(locator.get<LoggerService>()),
    );
  }
  
  @override
  List<Type> get exports => [UserService];
}

// Initialize the application
void main() async {
  final container = ApplicationContainer();
  await container.registerModule(AppModule());
  
  // Use services
  final userService = container.get<UserService>();
  final users = userService.getUsers();
  print('Users: $users');
}
```

## Why Choose Nest Dart?

### 🎯 **Proven Architecture**
Based on NestJS patterns used by thousands of Node.js applications, adapted for Dart's type system and ecosystem.

### 🔧 **Framework Agnostic**
Works with any Dart application - Flutter apps, Dart Frog backends, CLI tools, or pure Dart libraries.

### 🛡️ **Type Safety**
Full compile-time type checking with generics ensures your dependencies are always correctly typed.

### 🧪 **Testable by Design**
Easy dependency mocking and isolated testing with clear module boundaries.

### 📈 **Scalable**
Add new features as modules without affecting existing code. Perfect for growing applications.

### 🎨 **Developer Experience**
Clean, intuitive API with excellent IDE support and helpful error messages.
